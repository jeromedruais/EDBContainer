Postgres Plus Advanced Server 9.4 Docker Image
----------------------------------------------

Image is invoked with one of three commands:
  initdb - trailing args (if any) passed to initdb
      Provide ENTERPRISEDB_PASSWORD environment var when using
        initdb.
  start - trailing args (if any) passed to postmaster
  replica - expects 1st following arg to be the Primary db server;
      additional trailing args (if any) passed to pg_basebackup
Any other command (e.g. `/bin/bash`) passed directly to exec.
Note: The container runs as the user enterprisedb, not as root.
